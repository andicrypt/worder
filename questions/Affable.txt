Which of the following words is most similar in meaning to "affable"?  

A) Hostile  
B) Gregarious  
C) Taciturn  
D) Aloof  

**Correct Answer:** B) Gregarious  

**Explanation:**  
"Affable" means friendly, good-natured, or easy to talk to. "Gregarious" also conveys a sense of sociability and friendliness, making it the most similar in meaning. "Hostile" and "aloof" both suggest unfriendliness or detachment, while "taciturn" implies being reserved or uncommunicative, all of which are contrary to "affable."
