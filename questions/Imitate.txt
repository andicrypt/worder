**Question:**

Which of the following words is most similar in meaning to "imitate"?

A) Innovate  
B) Emulate  
C) Deviate  
D) Originate  

**Correct Answer:** B) Emulate

**Explanation:**  
To "imitate" means to follow the manner or pattern of something or someone, often with the intention of resembling or mimicking it. The word "emulate" is similar in meaning, as it also involves striving to equal or surpass someone or something, often by imitating. "Innovate" and "originate" involve creating something new or original, while "deviate" means to depart from an established course, which are not similar to "imitate."
