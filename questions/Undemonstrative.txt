**Question:**

The CEO was known for his undemonstrative nature, often keeping his emotions hidden even in moments of great success. Which of the following words best describes a person who is undemonstrative?

A) Effusive  
B) Reticent  
C) Gregarious  
D) Loquacious  

**Correct Answer: B) Reticent**

- **Reticent** means not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily, which aligns with the definition of undemonstrative.
- **Gregarious** means sociable and fond of company, which does not match the definition of undemonstrative.
- **Loquacious** means very talkative, which also does not align with being undemonstrative.
