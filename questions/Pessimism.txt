**Question:**

Which of the following best captures the meaning of the word "pessimism"?

A) Optimism  
B) Realism  
C) Cynicism  
D) Enthusiasm  

**Correct Answer: C) Cynicism**  

**Explanation:**  
"Pessimism" is the belief that events will turn out badly or a tendency to expect the worst. "Cynicism" shares this negative outlook, as it often involves a distrust of people's motives and a general skepticism about positive outcomes. "Optimism" and "enthusiasm" are opposite to pessimism, as they indicate a hopeful and positive outlook. "Realism" suggests a practical and balanced view, which doesn't necessarily align with the negativity of pessimism.
