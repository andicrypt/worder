**Question:**  

In the context of art and creativity, which of the following best describes something that is "original"?

A) **Authentic**

B) Reproduced

C) Conventional

D) Imitative

**Correct Answer: A) Authentic**  

**Explanation:**  
The word "original" refers to something created directly and personally by a particular artist, not a copy or imitation. Therefore, "authentic" is the best choice as it implies genuineness and originality. The other options suggest replication or commonality, which do not align with the definition of "original."
