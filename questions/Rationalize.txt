**Question:**

In the context of decision-making, which of the following scenarios best illustrates the act of "rationalizing"?

A) Julia decided to donate a portion of her salary to charity after reading a book about philanthropy.

B) Mark skipped his workout because he was feeling under the weather, and he knew rest was more important for recovery.

C) Lisa forgot to complete her assignment and argued that it was acceptable because she claims she works better under pressure.

D) David meticulously planned his schedule to ensure he had ample time for both work and leisure activities.

**Correct Answer: C) Lisa forgot to complete her assignment and argued that it was acceptable because she claims she works better under pressure.**

This choice demonstrates rationalizing because Lisa is trying to justify her behavior (forgetting to complete an assignment) with a logical reason (working better under pressure) that may not be appropriate or true.
