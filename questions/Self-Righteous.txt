**Question:**

In the heated debate, Alice's tone was distinctly self-righteous, leading others to perceive her as __________.

A) humble

B) modest

C) sanctimonious

D) empathetic

**Correct Answer: C) sanctimonious**

**Explanation:** 

The word "self-righteous" implies a sense of moral superiority and certainty in one's correctness, often without basis. "Sanctimonious" is a synonym that conveys a similar sense of perceived moral superiority. In contrast, "humble" and "modest" suggest a lack of arrogance, and "empathetic" refers to understanding and sharing the feelings of others, which are not directly related to being self-righteous.

**Question:**

In a heated debate, Carla's tone became increasingly self-righteous, leading her opponents to feel that she was dismissing their viewpoints as invalid. Which of the following words best describes Carla's attitude?

A) Apathetic  
B) Humble  
C) Overconfident  
D) Uncertain  

**Correct Answer: C) Overconfident**  

**Explanation:** A self-righteous attitude is characterized by a certainty or belief in one's moral superiority, often without justification. Among the options, "Overconfident" most closely aligns with this attitude, as it implies a level of certainty and self-assuredness that may not be warranted.
